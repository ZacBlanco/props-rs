# props-rs

`props-rs` is a parser library which can parse Java `properties` file
definitions. This library is a fork and improvement of an older, unmaintained
(and now, non-public) version of the
[`dotproperties`](https://crates.io/crates/dotproperties) library on crates.io.

It was modernized to use some more modern Rust features as well as use the
latest `nom` parsing library.
